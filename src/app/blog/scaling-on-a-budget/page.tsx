                        Every business dreams of growth. But as your website's traffic increases, so do the demands on your hosting. The last thing you want is for your success to be punished by a slow website or a hosting bill that suddenly balloons out of control. A key part of our business strategy at Grock Technologies is to provide a clear, affordable, and painless growth path for our customers.

                        Your hosting shouldn't hold you back. It should be a flexible foundation that supports your growth at every stage. In this post, we'll walk you through our hosting tiers, explaining the logic behind them and how they're designed to help you scale your business on a budget.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl text-foreground">The Starting Point: "Single Website" Plan</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our entry-level plan is designed for those who are just starting out: a personal blog, a portfolio site, or a brand-new small business website.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>What it offers:</strong> This plan gives you everything you need for one successful website, including a generous 50 GB of super-fast NVMe storage, unlimited bandwidth, and a free email account.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why it's so affordable:</strong> We've priced this plan to remove the barrier to entry for getting a professional website online. We know that if we provide a great experience from day one, you'll stay with us as you grow. It's an investment in a long-term relationship. The resources are more than enough for most new sites, ensuring you're not paying for capacity you don't need.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl text-foreground">The Growth Engine: "Web Starter" Plan</h2>
                    <p>
                        This is our most popular plan, and for good reason. It's the perfect sweet spot for those who are seeing their traffic grow, freelancers who manage a few client sites, or businesses looking to expand their online presence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What it offers:</strong> The "Web Starter" plan is a significant step up. You can host up to 100 websites and get 100 GB of NVMe storage. The most crucial upgrade, however, is the inclusion of free daily backups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why it's the smart choice for growth:</strong> As your website becomes more important to your business, the risk of data loss becomes more severe. Daily backups are an essential insurance policy. This plan allows you to experiment with new ideas—a new marketing site, a separate blog, a landing page for a campaign—without needing to buy a new hosting plan for each one. It provides the flexibility to grow your digital footprint at a very low incremental cost.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl text-foreground">The Powerhouse: "Business Website" Plan</h2>
                    <p>
                        This plan is built for established businesses, busy e-commerce stores, and agencies managing multiple client websites. It's designed for sites where performance and resources are mission-critical.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>What it offers:</strong> The "Business Website" plan doubles your storage to 200 GB and includes all the features of the starter plan, plus a free Content Delivery Network (CDN).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Why it's essential for business:</strong> A CDN dramatically improves website speed for a global audience by caching your content in servers around the world. For an e-commerce store or a business with international customers, this is a game-changer that can directly translate to higher conversions and better user experience. This plan provides the robust resources needed to handle significant traffic spikes and data-intensive applications without breaking a sweat.
                    </p>

                    <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl text-foreground">Painless Upgrades and a One-Time Fee</h2>
                    <p>
                        Scaling shouldn't be complicated. You can upgrade your plan at any time directly from your account dashboard. More importantly, we believe in rewarding loyalty.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our one-time website building fee is only for your very first plan with us. When you outgrow your current plan and upgrade, or if you decide to purchase a second plan for a different project, **you will not pay this fee again.** It's our way of saying thank you for continuing to grow with Grock.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl text-foreground">Conclusion: A Partner in Your Growth</h2>
                    <p>
                        Our pricing tiers aren't arbitrary. They are a carefully considered pathway designed to support your journey from a single idea to a thriving online business.
